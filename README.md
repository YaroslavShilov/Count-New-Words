# Count-New-Words application

## Description

When you encounter a new word while reading, watching a video, or doing something else, you often don’t know how many times you’ll see that word again, and you can’t decide whether to learn it or not.

With this application, you can add the word and count every time you come across it. After reading or watching, you get a summary of how many times the word appeared. This helps you decide whether to learn the word or not.
